        BMW's iX Flow concept car can change colour "at the touch of a button"
      </h2>

      <p>
        Car brand BMW has unveiled an updated version of its electric iX SUV at
        the Consumer Electronics Show that can change colour from black to white
        in order to suit the driver's mood and conserve electricity. Dubbed iX
        Flow, the concept car is wrapped in a kind of "digital paper" that is
        also used to form the screen of the Kindle e-reader. This can change
        colour in one fluid motion when prompted by an electrical impulse,
        making it possible for the driver to match their car to their personal
        style or the weather.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each sheet contains millions of microcapsules, about as wide as a human
        hair, filled with negatively-charged white pigments and
        positively-charged black pigments. Stimulating these capsules with
        electricity will prompt the chosen colour ink to move to the surface of
        the capsule, becoming visible from the outside. Unlike traditional
        screens, the digital paper does not emit light and only uses power to
        change colour, not to maintain it.

      <h2>Humanoid Robot : Ameca</h2>

      <p>
        Artificial intelligence, or AI, is one of the most prolific areas of
        research in several fields. AI has vast potential to improve medicine
        and many other fields of research. Typically, an AI lives inside a
        computer system constrained inside the digital realm. However, a company
        called Engineered Arts has developed what it calls an AB, or artificial
        body, that will give an AI a physical place to reside.

        Ameca Humanoid Robot Puts AI In A Gender-Neutral, 'Non-Threatening' Body
        Engineered Arts BY SHANE MCGLAUN EST Artificial intelligence, or AI, is
        one of the most prolific areas of research in several fields. AI has
        vast potential to improve medicine and many other fields of research.
        Typically, an AI lives inside a computer system constrained inside the
        digital realm. However, a company called Engineered Arts has developed
        what it calls an AB, or artificial body, that will give an AI a physical
        place to reside. The Ameca humanoid robot is designed to work with
        humans and provide relatable natural human gestures. It's designed with
        upgradeable modular mechanics and can be controlled via a cloud-managed
        API dev kit. The company says its robot has ground-breaking advances in
        movement and natural gestures, intelligent interaction and provides a
        future-proof software system. Engineered Arts also says that its API
        offers customization pathways that weren't available previously.

      <h2>Flying cars: SkyDrive SD-XX</h2>

      <p>
        Founded in July 2018, SkyDrive is an electric vertical takeoff and
        landing (eVTOL) company based in Toyota City, Japan. Tomohiro Fukuzawa
        is the chief executive officer and Nobuo Kishi is the chief technology
        officer. (All photos and graphics, SkyDrive credit.) A brief history of
        the company reveals that in September 2012, Tomohiro Fukuzawa formed a
        volunteer group automotive, drone and aviation industry professionals,
        who would meet outside of business hours and started discussions by
        first stating "Let's do something interesting". Based on Fukuzawa
        automotive background, he asked the group a fundamental question, "Why
        do people move?" Eventually, more than 100 ideas were talked about, such
        as cars which could also be submarines, to small enough cars that could
        move from room to room, inside a building.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a year and a half of discussions, in 2013, the group decided on
        flying cars. The company they formed was called Cartivator. The company
        name was created by combining the word car and cultivate with the
        definition of cultivate being more towards the word pioneer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the business matured, it became difficult to continue with volunteer
        workers. This why that in July 2018, about 30 people from Cartivator
        founded the SkyDrive Corporation. The company's goals for developing
        eVTOL advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft is to make safer aircraft,
        less costly aircraft, less noisy aircraft, autonomous aircraft and
        aircraft that require less infrastructure.
